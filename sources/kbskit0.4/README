This source files from this extension are from the [Kitgen] system (see
README.kitgen), The following changes are made:

* All building is done with the TEA build system.
* Thread is used as a static extension because of the use of Thread_Init()
  in the kitInit.c file.
* setupvfs.tcl is modified for the new structure

To build succesfull additional extensions are necessary (README.kitgen).
