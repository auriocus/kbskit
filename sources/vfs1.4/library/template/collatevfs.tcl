Version 1.5.3

A collate/broadcast/collect/catchup virtual filesystem.  Requires the template vfs in templatevfs.tcl.

Collate: reads from multiple specified directories and presents the results as one at the mount location.

Broadcast: applies all writes in the mount location to multiple specified directories.

Collect: copies any file read from or written to any of the above locations to specified directories. 

Catchup: If any specified directory is not available during any write action, the action is recorded in 
a catchup queue.  With each subsequent write action, the queue is examined, and if any directory has 
become available, the action is performed, allowing offline directories to "catch up."

Usage: mount ?-read <directories> -write <directories> -collect <directories> -catchup <directories>? <virtual directory>

Each pathname in <directories> is meant to stand individually, the <directories> symbol is not meant to indicate a 
Tcl list.  The sets of specified locations are independent; they can overlap or not as desired.  Note each
option flag is optional, one could for example use only the -read flag to create a read-only directory.  Directories
do not have to exist and may go missing after mount, non-reachable locations will be ignored.

Options:

-read
When an individual file is opened for reading, each of the directories specified is searched in 
order for the file; the first file found with the appropriate name is opened.  When a subdirectory listing is 
generated, the combined files of the corresponding subdirectory of all specified directories are listed together.

-write
When an individual file is opened for writing, each of the directories specified is searched in 
order for the file; the first file found with the appropriate name is opened.  If the file doesn't exist, 
it is created in the first specified write location.  When the file is closed, a copy of it is distributed to 
each specified write directory.

-collect
Auto-generates one or more file caches; a copy of any file opened for reading or writing in any of the above 
specified directories is made to each directory specified with the -collect flag.  Collect locations are 
not included in file or directory listings, and are not searched for read access; so in order to make an 
active read cache, for example, one would have to include one directory location in both the -read and -collect sets.

-catchup
If this flag is included, the catchup function is activated, and a copy of the catchup queue is stored in a
file in each of the specified directories.  File writes, directory creations and file/directory deletes are
stored in the catchup queue if any write location is offline; at the next write/creation/delete the queue is 
examined, and if any skipped action can be completed due to a location becoming available again, it 
will be.  A catchup attempt will be made at mount time if this flag is included.

The values of each option can be changed dynamically after mount by using the "file attributes" command on the
mount virtual directory. Each option is editable as an attribute; i.e., "file attributes C:/collate -write C:/tmp"

The collate vfs inherits the -cache and -volume options of the template vfs.


Example use: specify parallel locations on a hard drive, on a CD-ROM mount and an ftp vfs as the read list.
Files will be read first from the hard drive, if not found there the CD-ROM and ftp site will be searched in turn.
The hard drive can be specified as the single write location, and no writes to the CD-ROM or 
ftp site will ever be attempted:

mount -read C:/install/package/docs CDROM:/package/docs FTP:/pub/releases/package/docs -write C:/install/package/docs C:/collate/docs


Example collect location use: specify a single hard drive location as a read and collect directory.  
Specify a ftp vfs as a secondary read directory.  As ftp files are downloaded they are copied to the 
collect directory; the local copies are accessed first on subsequent reads: hence the collect
specification produces a self-generating local cache:

mount -read C:/install/package/images FTP:/pub/releases/package/images -collect C:/install/package/images C:/collate/images
